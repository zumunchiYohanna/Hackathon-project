# API Security Test Plan

**Project:** Delivery System  
**Role:** Security & Integration Engineer — Member 3  
**Purpose:** Test the backend API for authentication, authorization, input validation, business-logic security, failure handling, and common API security weaknesses.

---

| Expired JWT/token | Request rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Malformed authentication token | Request rejected safely | Pending backend API | ⏳ |

---

## 2. Authorization & Access Control Testing

The purpose of these tests is to verify that authenticated users can only access resources and operations allowed for their role.

| Invalid order ID | Request rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Negative quantity | Request rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Quantity of zero | Request rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Invalid OTP | Request rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Missing OTP | Request rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Malformed JSON | Request rejected safely | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Unexpected data type | Request rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Unexpected/unsupported value | Request rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |

## 5. JWT & Session Security

When authentication is implemented, verify:

- [ ] Protected endpoints require authentication.
- [ ] Invalid tokens are rejected.
- [ ] Expired tokens are rejected.
- [ ] Tokens cannot be modified to gain another user's privileges.
- [ ] User roles are not trusted solely from client-controlled data.
- [ ] Sensitive tokens are not exposed in API responses unnecessarily.
- [ ] Logout/token invalidation works where required.
- [ ] JWT secrets are stored through environment configuration.
- [ ] Authentication errors do not reveal sensitive information.

---

## 6. OTP Security

For pickup and delivery verification:

- [ ] Correct OTP is accepted.
- [ ] Incorrect OTP is rejected.
- [ ] Missing OTP is rejected.
- [ ] Expired OTP is rejected.
- [ ] OTP cannot be reused after successful verification.
- [ ] OTP attempts are protected against excessive guessing.
- [ ] OTP values are not unnecessarily exposed in API responses.
- [ ] OTPs are not stored or logged insecurely.

---

## 7. Order & Delivery Business Logic Testing

Verify that the delivery workflow follows the correct state transitions.

| Scenario | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Complete order before pickup | Rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Complete order with invalid OTP | Rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Complete order with valid OTP | Allowed when state is correct | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Accept already assigned delivery | Rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Unauthorized rider completes delivery | Rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Failed delivery is settled immediately | Rejected/blocked | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Invalid order status transition | Rejected | Pending backend API | ⏳ |
| Repeat sensitive operation | Safely rejected/idempotent | Pending backend API | ⏳ |

1. Rider reports item unavailable.
2. System records the incident.
3. Fulfillment process can be triggered again where appropriate.

- [ ] Incident is recorded.
- [ ] Unauthorized users cannot create/modify incidents.
- [ ] Order remains in a valid state.

### Rider Decline

Expected behavior:

1. Rider declines delivery.
2. System records the decline.
3. Another suitable rider can be considered.

- [ ] Decline is recorded.
- [ ] Dispatch can search for another rider.
- [ ] Unauthorized users cannot manipulate the assignment.

### Rider Timeout

Expected behavior:

1. Rider does not respond.
2. Request expires.
3. Another suitable rider can be considered.

- [ ] Timeout is handled.
- [ ] Delivery does not become incorrectly completed.
- [ ] Assignment state remains consistent.

### Invalid Pickup Code

## 9. API Rate-Limit & Abuse Testing

The backend currently includes rate-limiting support.

Test sensitive endpoints for excessive requests:

- [ ] Login requests are protected against excessive attempts.
- [ ] OTP verification is protected against excessive attempts.
- [ ] Sensitive operations cannot be repeatedly abused.
- [ ] API returns an appropriate response when the rate limit is exceeded.
- [ ] Rate limiting does not expose sensitive system information.

---

## 10. API Error Handling

Verify that errors are handled safely.

- [ ] Invalid requests return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- [ ] Unauthorized requests return an appropriate response.
- [ ] Forbidden requests return an appropriate response.
- [ ] Invalid IDs do not cause server crashes.
- [ ] Database errors do not expose database credentials.
- [ ] Errors do not expose stack traces in production.
- [ ] Errors do not reveal passwords, tokens, API keys, or other secrets.
- [ ] Error responses remain understandable without exposing internal implementation details.

---

## 11. Sensitive Data Exposure

Check API responses for unnecessary sensitive information.

- [ ] Password hashes are never returned.
- [ ] JWT secrets are never returned.
- [ ] API keys are never returned.
- [ ] Database credentials are never returned.
- [ ] Internal database details are not unnecessarily exposed.
- [ ] Sensitive user information is only returned to authorized users.
- [ ] Notification responses do not unnecessarily expose sensitive information.

---

## 12. Security Headers & CORS

Verify the backend security configuration:

- [ ] Helmet/security headers are enabled.
- [ ] CORS allows only appropriate origins.
- [ ] Unauthorized origins are handled appropriately.
- [ ] Production configuration does not allow unnecessarily broad access.

---

## 13. Logging & Audit Testing

The system includes database structures for audit logs and security-related events.

Verify:

- [ ] Failed authentication attempts can be logged.
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts can be logged.

- [ ] Logs do not contain passwords.
- [ ] Logs do not contain authentication tokens.
- [ ] Logs do not contain API secrets.
- [ ] Audit records cannot be modified by unauthorized users.

---

## 14. Notification Security

Verify:

- [ ] Notifications are delivered to the intended user.
- [ ] A user cannot access another user's notifications.
- [ ] Sensitive information is not unnecessarily included.
- [ ] Notification events are correctly identified.
- [ ] Failed notification attempts are handled safely.
- [ ] Duplicate sensitive notifications are controlled where required.

## Security Test Status

**Current Status:** Prepared — Awaiting Backend API Integration

**Role:** Security & Integration Engineer — Member 3

**Project:** Delivery System

**Note:** Tests marked as pending will be executed against the real backend API once the backend endpoints are available. Standalone authentication, authorization, input-validation, and failure-path tests have already been implemented separately in this security module.
