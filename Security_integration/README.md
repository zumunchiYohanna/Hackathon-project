# Security & Integration Engineer

This project contains the security, API integration, testing, notification, and deployment-support components of the Delivery System team project.

## Role and Responsibilities

As the Security & Integration Engineer, my responsibilities include:

* Implementing and supporting security controls
* Testing authentication, authorization, and access control
* Testing security failure paths and edge cases
* Supporting API and system integration
* Implementing the notification system
* Maintaining security documentation and checklists
* Supporting secure configuration and deployment
* Identifying and reducing security risks
* Testing security requirements before deployment

## Project Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Security Testing

**File:** `authentication-tests.js`

This module contains security tests for authentication, authorization, and input validation.

Current tests include:

* Incorrect password handling
* Missing credentials
* Invalid or expired authentication tokens
* Unauthorized access attempts
* Customer access to rider endpoints
* Rider access to customer endpoints
* Business access to another business's data
* Unauthorized admin access
* Empty input values
* Invalid IDs
* Invalid quantities
* Invalid OTPs
* Malformed requests

These tests currently provide standalone security verification. Real API testing will be performed when the backend endpoints are available.

### 2. Failure-Path Testing

**File:** `failure-tests.js`

The failure-path testing module verifies how the system should respond when expected conditions are not met.

Current tests include:

* Preventing an order from being completed before pickup
* Rejecting invalid delivery OTPs
* Validating successful order completion
* Handling rider timeouts
* Searching for another suitable rider after timeout
* Handling unavailable items
* Handling rider declines
* Rejecting invalid pickup codes
* Blocking settlement after failed delivery
* Supporting admin/support investigation of failed deliveries

### 3. Notification System

**File:** `notification.js`

The notification module provides an in-app notification system for important system and security events.

Current functionality includes:

* Sending notifications to users
* Recording notification event types
* Recording notification timestamps
* Tracking notification delivery status
* Preparing for future email, SMS, and push notification integration

The current implementation prioritizes the in-app notification MVP.

### 4. API Security Test Plan

**File:** `api-security-test-plan.md`

The API Security Test Plan defines the tests that will be performed against the real backend API.

It covers:

* Authentication
* Authorization and role-based access control
* Resource ownership
* Input validation
* JWT/session security
* OTP security
* Order and delivery business logic
* Failure-path testing
* Rate limiting and abuse controls
* API error handling
* Sensitive data exposure
* Security headers and CORS
* Logging and audit testing
* Notification security
* Dependency and configuration review

**Current status:** Prepared and awaiting backend API integration.

### 5. Security Checklist

**File:** `security-checklist.md`

The security checklist documents security requirements that should be reviewed and tested.

It covers:

* Authentication and session handling
* Authorization and access control
* Input validation and sanitization
* Data protection
* API and network security
* Order and delivery security
* Notification security
* Failure-path and resilience testing
* Logging and monitoring
* Security testing and review

### 6. Environment Configuration

**File:** `.env.example`

The environment configuration template contains example settings for:

* Server configuration
* Database connection
* Authentication
* Password hashing
* Future notification API integration

Real secrets must never be committed to GitHub.

The `.gitignore` configuration excludes `.env` files and `node_modules`.

## Security Approach

The project follows important cybersecurity principles, including:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* Least privilege
* Input validation
* Secure handling of sensitive information
* Failure-path testing
* Security logging and monitoring
* Secure configuration management
* Role-based access control
* Protection of secrets and credentials

## Testing

Security testing focuses on both normal operations and failure conditions.

Examples include:

* Incorrect credentials
* Missing credentials
* Invalid or expired authentication tokens
* Unauthorized access attempts
* Cross-role access attempts
* Cross-business data access
* Invalid OTPs
* Invalid pickup codes
* Invalid order states
* Rider timeouts
* Rider declines
* Unavailable items
* Failed deliveries
* Unexpected or malformed input
* Invalid quantities and IDs

Standalone security and failure-path tests have been implemented and functionally verified.

## Backend API Integration

Real API security testing depends on the availability of the backend API.

The following tests will be performed once the backend endpoints are available:

* Real authentication testing
* JWT/token validation
* Authorization enforcement
* Customer order ownership
* Business catalogue ownership
* Rider delivery ownership
* Admin access control
* Invalid state transitions
* API error handling
* Rate limiting
* Sensitive response exposure
* Logging and audit verification
* End-to-end security testing

Authorization must be enforced by the backend rather than relying only on frontend restrictions.

## Security Considerations

The project is designed to reduce common security risks by:

* Restricting access according to user roles
* Validating user input
* Protecting authentication information
* Avoiding unnecessary exposure of sensitive information
* Testing unexpected system conditions
* Keeping secrets outside the public repository
* Testing failure conditions before deployment

## Project Status

**Status:** In Progress

Completed security work includes:

* Authentication security testing
* Authorization and access-control testing
* Input validation testing
* Failure-path testing
* Notification MVP
* Security checklist
* API Security Test Plan
* Secrets protection
* Git/GitHub integration

Remaining work depends mainly on backend API availability and includes:

* Real API security testing
* Backend authorization verification
* End-to-end order and delivery security testing
* Notification backend integration
* Logging and monitoring verification
* Dependency/vulnerability review
* Deployment and integration testing
* Final security review

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:

* Email notification integration
* SMS notification integration
* Push notification integration
* Stronger authentication controls
* Automated API security testing
* Improved logging and monitoring
* Dependency and vulnerability scanning
* Production deployment security
* Additional failure-path testing
